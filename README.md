# BEFORE USING THE WEB APPLICATION

Our database is on a free tier, it will ***automatically reduce it's response time*** if it did not receive requests in a long period of time.

Therefore, when testing the application, **after** you have logged in with your google account, ***please wait*** in the home page for ***5-10 min***, to allow the web to rerive data from the database, after that, the database will resume to normal traffic speed. 

Try it Now!
